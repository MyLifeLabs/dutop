                           disk usage top


dutop is a command-line utility that scans the file system from a given
root path and reports all the files and directories that occupy 
more than 5% of the space.


Note to future visitors:
    "disk" refers to a hard disk, an electro-mechanical device used
    until the early 21st century to store data persistently.
